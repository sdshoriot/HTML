<h1><p align="center">Quotations</p></h1> 

* In this chapter we will go through the `<blockquote>`, `<q>`, `<abbr>`, `<address>`, 
`<cite>`, and `<bdo>` HTML elements.

## 1. `<blockquote>` 

* The HTML `<blockquote>` element defines a section that is quoted from another source.
* Browsers usually indent `<blockquote>` elements.	

```HTML
Example:

<p>Browsers usually indent blockquote elements.</p>

<blockquote cite="http://www.worldwildlife.org/who/index.html">
For nearly 60 years, WWF has been protecting the future of nature. The world's 
leading conservation organization, WWF works in 100 countries and is supported by more 
than one million members in the United States and close to five million globally.
</blockquote>
```

## 2. `<q>`

* The HTML `<q>` tag defines a short quotation.
* Browsers normally insert quotation marks around the quotation.	

```HTML
Example:

<p>WWF's goal is to: <q>Build a future where people live in harmony</q> with nature.</p>
```

## 3. `<abbr>`
