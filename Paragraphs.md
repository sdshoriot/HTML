<h1><p align="center">Paragraphs</p></h1>


## 1. Paragraphs

* The HTML `<p>` element defines a paragraph.


```HTML
Example:

<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
```

## 2. Display

* With HTML, you cannot change the display by adding extra spaces or extra lines in your
HTML code.

* The browser will automatically remove any extra spaces and lines when the page is displayed:

```HTML
Example:

<p>
This paragraph
contains a lot of lines
in the source code,
but the browser 
ignores it.
</p>

<p>
This paragraph
contains      a lot of spaces
in the source     code,
but the    browser 
ignores it.
</p>

<p>
The number of lines in a paragraph depends on the size of the browser window. 
If you resize the browser window, the number of lines in this paragraph will change.
</p>
```


## 3. Horizontal Rules

* The `<hr>` tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page, and is most often displayed as 
a horizontal rule.

* The `<hr>` element is used to separate content (or define a change) in an HTML page:

* The `<hr>` tag is an empty tag, which means that it has no end tag.


```HTML
Example:

<h1>This is heading 1</h1>
<p>This is some text.</p>
<hr>
<h2>This is heading 2</h2>
<p>This is some other text.</p>
<hr>
```

## 4. Line Breaks

* The HTML `<br>` element defines a line break.

* The `<br>` tag is an empty tag, which means that it has no end tag.

```HTML
Example:

<p>This is<br>a paragraph<br>with line breaks.</p>
```

## 5. The Poem Solution 

* The HTML `<pre>` element defines preformatted text.

* The text inside a `<pre>` element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier), 
and it preserves both spaces and line breaks:


```HTML
<pre>
   My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

   				My Bonnie lies over the sea.

   My Bonnie lies over the ocean.
   
				Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
</pre>
```
